the following capitalized titles of TPM Manufacturer, OEM, and Owner are keywords that will be referenced throughout this paper

simplified version of the process for creating and distributing TPM-containing devices to the end user

\begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{ite:idTPM} TPM Manufacturers produce TPM chips according to the international standard. They provision each TPM chip with one or more certificates which bind a key to that specific TPM. These chips are then distributed to the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).
  \item\label{ite:idDevIni} OEMs produce devices (e.g., PCs) with these TPM chips integrated. They provision each TPM chip with one or more certificates which bind a key to that specific device. These devices are then distributed to the end users (Owners).
  \item\label{ite:idDevLoc} Owners may optionally provision their TPM chip(s) with one or more certificates which bind a key to that specific device.
\end{enumerate} 

the provisioning of device identification in Steps \ref{ite:idDevIni} and \ref{ite:idDevLoc} is the subject of this paper
